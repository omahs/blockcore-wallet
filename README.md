### Normal vs Quick

When adding additional accounts to your wallet, you have the option to choose the modes `Normal` and `Quick`. The difference can be very important depending on your usage and needs.

`Normal` will retrieve all transaction history for your wallet, and calculate the balance locally. When sending transactions, the available unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are queried locally in the history of data.

`Quick` will retrieve only the current balance information from the indexer APIs, even for very large wallets, this is very quick to do. When sending transactions, the indexer API is queried until the amount being sent has been fulfilled. This means even if you have thousands of UTXOs, the wallet does not need to download all the data to perform transactions.
